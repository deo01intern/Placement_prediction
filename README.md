# Placement_prediction

@Author: Deo Kumar Das

It is a Machine Learning project build on  Gradient Descent  algorithm with multiple variables  to predict the probability of placement in the campus. The datas are stored in the form of Excel File and it consists of many features which help in getting placement and it is Normalized.

The  3D-Scatter graph is plotted based on two skills and the answer sets using Matplot library file  of Python .The goal of regression is to determine the values of the  theta  parameters that minimize the sum of the squared residual values (difference betwen predicted and the observed) for the set of observations. Since linear regression is restricted to fiting linear (straight line/plane) functions to data.
